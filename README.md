# Project Chatbot - Puppy rescue

For week one of the Technigo bootcamp (first week of the JavaScript sprint) our assignment was to create a chatbot, taking inputs in some form and posting answers depending on the input. This project was made in collaboration with Saralie Bognandi and it was our first project using using Javascript. The chatbot is guiding the user through an interactive story where a hero can help resuing a puppy from a terrible dragon.


## The problem

For player choices we have used if/else statements and we have used javascrip to modify inner HTML of various elements. We have stored objects in an array (heroInventory) and used it to trigger different conditions for if/else statements. 

If we had more time we would have worked more on the design, and to get the setTimeout functions more accuratly. 
The code is very linear, flowing from top to bottom and quite repetative. We would have liked to have a more effecient structure of the code and reusability of functions.
