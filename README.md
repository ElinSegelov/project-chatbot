# Project Name - Puppy rescue (chat-bot)

We were tasked with creating a chat-bot and decided to do an interactive story where a hero can help to resue a puppy from a terrible dragon.

✓ How to use variables in JavaScript.

✓ How to use conditionals in JavaScript.

✓ Know some string methods to modify strings.

✓ Understand control flow and the use of conditionals statements.

✓ How to use functions in JavaScript

✓ Different datatypes

## The problem

For player choises we have used if/else statements and we have used javascrip to modify inner HTML of various elements. We have stored objects in an array (heroInventory) and used it to trigger different conditions for if/else statements. 

Next step wpuld be to work on the CSS, and to get the setTimeout more correct. 
The code is very linear, flowing from top to bottom and quite repetative. We would have liked to have a more effecient structure of the code and reusability of functions.
